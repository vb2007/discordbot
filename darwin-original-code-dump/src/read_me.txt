This is much easier using linux, even better a vps in the cloud.

1.) install nodejs

on linux run
npm install nodejs

on windows, visist the nodejs website and install that way


2) once installed, run console command in the package.json directory
npm install


3) create a bot application at https://discord.com/developers/applications

Put it's id and token in the settings.json
You will have to find where to see the discord token somewhere in the developer UI tabs.

4) Run darwin using node as such
node gbot.js

And then you will see the invite url to invite darwin into your server
