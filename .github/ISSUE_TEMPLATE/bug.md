You can describe the issue however you want. But if you can, please try to follow the template below. If an issue is documented poorly, and the maintainer(s) can't understand your problem, your issue might get closed as "Not planned".

Please always take a look at the project itself, and at other issues before submittint a _supposedly unique_ issue.

## What should you include in the description (if possible)

- **Release version / date of last pull**
- ⚠**Screenshots**:  if you've captured the events, please send screenshots about anything that's relevant. _This helps a **lot** with the issue reproduction._
- **Pre conditions**: what should I do before trying to reproduce the bug?
- **Actual behavior**: what happened?
- **Expected behavior**: what should've happened?
- _(Optional, used in very few cases)_**Post conditions**: should I do anything else after trying to reproduce the issue?

If you're not sure about the details above, feel free to submit the issue anyways. It's great to have any feedback about the project. Sometimes even the maintaners don't know how will the outcome look like, before getting into developing the feature.

♥ **Every issue you describe with some effort is appreciated.** ♥
