You can describe the issue however you want. But if you can, please try to follow the template below. If an issue is documented poorly, and the maintainer(s) can't understand your problem, your issue might get closed as "Not planned".

Please always take a look at the project itself, and at other issues before submittint a _supposedly unique_ issue.

## What should you include in the description (if possible)

- Some well-detailed senteces about your idea. That's it.
- If you know what you're doing, you can explain the technical side of your concept.
- See these examples: https://github.com/vb2007/discordbot/issues/11 https://github.com/vb2007/discordbot/issues/37

If you're not sure about the details above, feel free to submit the issue anyways. Ideas are always great to have. Sometimes even the maintaners don't know how will the outcome look like, before getting into developing the feature.

♥ **Every issue you describe with some effort is appreciated.** ♥
