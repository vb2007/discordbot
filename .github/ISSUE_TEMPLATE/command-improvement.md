# Submitting an issue

♥ **Every issue you describe with some effort is appreciated.** ♥

⚠ **If you're having issues with an existing command, please submit a bug instead.** ⚠

You can describe the issue however you want. But if you can, please try to follow the template below. If an issue is documented poorly, and the maintainer(s) can't understand your problem, your issue might get closed as "Not planned".

## What should you include in the description (if possible)

If you can, please put these into the title as well in a short way.

- What /slash command should be improved?
- What improvement(s) will it get?
- See examples: https://github.com/vb2007/discordbot/issues/36 https://github.com/vb2007/discordbot/issues/27

If you're not sure about the details above, feel free to submit the issue anyways. Ideas are always great to have. Sometimes even the maintaners don't know how will the outcome look like, before getting into developing the feature.
