Please always take a look at the project itself, and at other issues before submittint a _supposedly unique_ issue.

---

This is kind of an odd issue type.

If you think something's wrong with the project's documentation, something's missing, something's outdated or something should be added, pick this template.

The following files can be considered as _documentation_:

- The project's main [README.md](../../README.md) file.
- Anything in the [documentation folder](../../documentation/).
- [Issue templates](../ISSUE_TEMPLATE/), like this.

---

Just describe the problem, and submit the issue (if it meets the criteria above).

♥ **Every issue you describe with some effort is appreciated.** ♥
