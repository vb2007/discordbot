# discordbot
A simple discord bot of mine developed with discord.js (Node.js).
I mainly use it to get the active developer badge on Discord.

## How to run the application
If you want to run this for some weird reason, then do the following:
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a `.env` file in it's folder and insert the following lines:
```env
TOKEN=[your token here]
CLIENTID=[your client id here]
```
3. Install the dependecies with the `npm i` command
4. Run the `index.js` file with the `node index.js` command
