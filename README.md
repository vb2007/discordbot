# Discord bot
A simple discord bot of mine developed with discord.js (Node.js).
I mainly use it to get the active developer badge on Discord.

## Invite the bot
**You can invite the bot to your server using [THIS](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1163073430309044234&scope=bot&permissions=8) link.**
The bot requires administartor permissions.
It should be online 24/7.

## How to run the application
If you want to run this for some weird reason, then do the following:
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a `config.json` file in it's folder and insert the following:
```json
{
  "token": "[your token]",
  "clientId": "[your client id]"
}
```
3. Install the dependecies with the `npm i` command
4. Run the app with the `npm run app` command
5. (Optional) To redeploy the / commands, run `npm run deploy`
