# discordbot
A simple discord bot of mine developed with node.js (discord.js).
I mainly use it to get the active developer badge on discord.

## How to run the application
If you want to run this for some weird reason, then do the following:
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a .env file in it's folder
3. Create 2 lines, **TOKEN=*your token here*** and **CLIENTID=*your client id here***
4. Install node.js and the discord.js package with the *npm install discord.js* command
5. Run the *index.js* file with the *node index.js* command
